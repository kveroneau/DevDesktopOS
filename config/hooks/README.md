# Live Image Customization hooks

Most of these hooks are from the `/usr/share/live/build/` directory, as these hooks are common for most Live CDs.  They have been created by the Debian Live team, and they should be symlinked instead, but for simplicity and completion, they are included here.

Additional hooks specific to this Debian Live spin may be added here in the future.
